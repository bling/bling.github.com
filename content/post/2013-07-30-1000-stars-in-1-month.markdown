# 1000 stars in 1 month

One month ago I pushed the first [commit][1] of my plugin [vim-airline][2].

Two weeks later I wrote a blog [post][3] about the experience.  By that time the plugin gained over 700 stars.

Two more weeks later, today the project has over 1000 stars.  Here are some other numbers:

*  35 merged pull requests
*  8 contributed airline themes
*  4 contributed ctrlp themes
*  23 total contributors
*  15 plugins integrated

Wow!  That is all I can say...
