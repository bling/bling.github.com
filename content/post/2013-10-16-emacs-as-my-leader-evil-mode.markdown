Hey guys, I just wanted to post a quick demo video on [evil-mode](https://gitorious.org/evil).

The video is targetted at intermediate/advanced Vim users, so if you're just starting out you might miss some things. But...hopefully it'll be an enjoyable watch regardless!

Let me know what you guys think of it!
