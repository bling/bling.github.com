<h3></h3> <h3>Infrastructure Refactor</h3> <p>A lot of things changed internally, and I mean….a lot….</p> <p>From an infrastructure standpoint, I decided to remove the dependency on LinqToTwitter, and I replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/danielcrenna/hammock">Hammock</a>.&nbsp; A couple things led me to this decision, one being the Silverlight support wasn’t as good as I’d hoped, and the streaming API implementation was limited.&nbsp; After reading the Twitter documentation I realized that the REST API was super simple and I’d be better off writing a simple interface to it.</p> <p>I heard good things about Hammock, so I decided to give that one a try (I wasn’t going to go as far as reimplementing OAuth).&nbsp; It was pretty easy to set up and in the end I was able to get Twitter working again and with less lines of code compared to the beginning of the refactor.</p> <h3>Goals</h3> <p>I had a couple goals for this project:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Learn:</strong>&nbsp; I was a complete newbie to Reactive Extensions when I started but now I understand it enough to hit the ground running with it.&nbsp; I’m still learning about more conventions available to Caliburn.Micro.  <li><strong>UX:</strong>&nbsp; I wanted to learn a little more about interface design.&nbsp; I wanted to know how little changes to gradients, shadows, colors, etc. could have a radically effect in the end result.  <li><strong>Performance:</strong>&nbsp; It should be fast.&nbsp; It should be able to react to real-time data.&nbsp; And it should do it with low CPU utilization.  <li><strong>Concise:</strong>&nbsp; I am a huge advocate for KISS.&nbsp; I like convention over configuration.&nbsp; I like implementing something in 2 lines of code rather than 20 (assuming it’s not cryptic).&nbsp; As I was writing the app and refactoring, if there was an opportunity to remove a line of code, I did it.&nbsp; The result is that the app currently consists of less than 500 lines of code as of this post (excluding XAML).</li></ul> <h3>Tidbits</h3> <p>What are some interest things I learned?</p> <ul> <li>System.Json is an amazing assembly.&nbsp; All you need to do is invoke JsonValue.Parse on a string and it will create a JsonValue for you, which will be a dictionary of key/value pairs.&nbsp; What’s more, by doing something like “string s = json[“text”]” will do an explicit conversion <strong>and unescape JSON characters</strong>, and <strong>only</strong> via the explicit operator.&nbsp; Calling ToString(), even though converting it to a string, will not unescape.&nbsp; This was completely undocumented and only found when I looked at the source code via Resharper’s external sources feature.  <li>Rx is awesome.&nbsp; When I ran into performance problems of trying to stream tweets from the world that contained the letter ‘a’ all I had to do was add an operator to improve the performance (in this case it was Buffer).&nbsp; It should be noted that it is <em>very important</em> to understand what Rx is doing underneath the hood to realize its benefits.&nbsp; Rx lets you refactor 30 lines of async code into 1 operator, but it’s still doing that 30 lines of code – you just don’t see it.  <li>I really, <em>really</em>, like the conventions available from Caliburn.&nbsp; Some of the features that come out of the box from this very small library saves me from writing a lot of boilerplate code like commands, triggers, and evening bindings (Caliburn will auto bind x:Name to a property).  <li>Twitter’s documentation for <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-api/user-streams">user streams</a> currently sucks and some trial and error was required to get it working.</li></ul> <p>What is the end result of all this effort?&nbsp; We have a styled Twitter app that can update your status, pull your home/mentions timeline, and most importantly will <strong>stream all subsequent tweets</strong>.&nbsp; There’s no pulling and no limits.&nbsp; You will get a tweet of everyone you follow in real-time as it happens.</p> <p>Moreover, there’s a feature to connect to the Streaming API to search Twitter for <em>anything</em>.&nbsp; To get an idea of what we’re talking about, here’s a full screenshot of it:</p> <p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-tB6iLGL85aE/TnNOi7hdq9I/AAAAAAAAAHE/wGjkyHQzYKs/image%25255B20%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="578" height="328"></p> <p>You read that right.&nbsp; I’m streaming any tweet in the world that has the words ‘and’, ‘the’, ‘yes’, <strong>or</strong> ‘no’ in them.&nbsp; This is streaming around 400kB/s continuously and CPU utilization is under 25%.&nbsp; The tweets are coming so fast it’s impossible to read them (at a rate of 50 tweets/second), so ideally you’d want to specify realistic search terms.</p> <p>Moreover, the majority of the performance cost is actually downloading all the profile images.&nbsp; If I take took out pictures I could stream any tweet in the world that has the letter ‘e’ in it at under 10% CPU.&nbsp; It looks like Twitter limits the rate of tweets to 50 tweets/second because that was the rate for this one as well.</p> <p>Features are minimalistic.&nbsp; You can update your status, but you can’t DM, you can’t RT, you can’t do any of the normal things.&nbsp; My original goal was not to write another Twitter client, but it’s actually quite fun to do so, so I’ll probably eventually get all features in.</p> <p>And as promised, it’s up on <a href="https://github.com/bling/Ping.Pong">GitHub</a>, and version 0.0.0.1 <strong>alpha</strong> (yes! expect bugs!!) is available in the downloads section.&nbsp; Or, here’s a direct link to the XAP file on my <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2072014/Ping.Pong/PingPongTestPage.html">Dropbox</a>.&nbsp; Have fun!</p>  </div>
