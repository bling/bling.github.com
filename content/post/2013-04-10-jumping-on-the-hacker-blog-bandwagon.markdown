# Following the tutorial...

Not much to say here...I went to [Octopress'](http://octopress.org) website, followed the instructions, and now I have a working blog.  Pretty cool.

It definitely feels liberating to blog using plain 'ol markdown text editing.

So I guess the next step I'll do is import my existing blog content, and then add some personal styling to this thing :)
