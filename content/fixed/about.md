You want to know a little more about me?

My name is Bailey Ling, a.k.a bling, and I've been building software for over a decade now.  I grew up in Canada and I'm currently working and residing in New York City.

One of my most successful creations is [vim-airline][1], a statusline plugin for Vim which is now being maintained by the community.  I've also [created][3] [some][2] [other][6] [useful][4] [things][5] for Vim and Emacs.
