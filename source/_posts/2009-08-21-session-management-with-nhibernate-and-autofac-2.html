Ooops, I forgot to mention that it's easily mockable as well.
<pre>
public class UserService : IUserService {
  public UserService(ISessionFactory factory, UsersRepositoryFactory usersFactory) { ... }
}
</pre>
So that's the basic thing right.  So now, with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">Moq</a>, we can do this:
<pre>
var mockUserRepo = new Mock&lt;IUsersRepository&gt;();
mockUserRepo.Setup(x =&gt; x.GetUser(It.IsAny&lt;string&gt;())).Returns(() =&gt; someUser);

var userService = new UserService(..., x => mockUserRepo.Object);
</pre>
So what I've basically done is insert a lambda expression into the constructor, which is the delegate, which always returns my mock repository.  Pretty nifty methinks!</div>
