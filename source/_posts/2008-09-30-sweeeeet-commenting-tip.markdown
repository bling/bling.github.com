No no no...this isn't another typical post splurging about how you should comment your code, just another sweet tip I got from a good friend of mine.

If you've been coding for a while you'll run into a time where you have 2 sections of code that you need to edit.  However, you can only have 1 section commented, and the 2nd section uncommented, or vice versa.  Even with the built-in keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C) and (Ctrl+K, Ctrl+U), it's still a pain in the behind.

To the rescue!

    /*   OR  //*
    1ST SECTION OF CODE
    /*/
    2ND SECTION OF CODE
    //*/

All you need to do is swap between `/*` and `//*` on the first line of code, and you can easily and quickly swap comments between the 2 sections of code.  Very handy at times...
