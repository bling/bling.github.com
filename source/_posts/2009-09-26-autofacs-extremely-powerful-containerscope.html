<div class='post'>
I need to show some love and support for my favorite IoC tool because it’s most powerful feature needs more explaining.&nbsp; It’s not that the main site doesn’t provide a good explanation, because it does, but because most people don’t really understand what the solution is solving.<br />
The following is on Autofac’s <a href="http://code.google.com/p/autofac/">front page</a>:<br />
<blockquote><pre class="csharpcode">var container = // ...
using (var inner = container.CreateInnerContainer())
{
  var controller = inner.Resolve&lt;IController&gt;();
  controller.Execute(); // use controller..
}</pre></blockquote>The first time I saw this I basically glanced right passed it.&nbsp; Honestly I didn’t think anything of it, and initially the reason I tried out Autofac was for its very slick lambda registrations.&nbsp; I didn’t realize I was in a world of surprises when I finally realized the power and flexibility of Autofac’s container scope.<br />
<br />
If <a href="http://www.codinginstinct.com/2008/05/ioc-container-benchmark-rerevisted.html">benchmarks</a> and <a href="http://blog.ashmind.com/index.php/2008/09/08/comparing-net-di-ioc-frameworks-part-2/">feature comparisons</a> are not enough show off Autofac’s features, this blog post hopes to show how to solve “complex” problems elegantly.<br />
<br />
Let’s start with the typical NHibernate use-case.&nbsp; Create 1 singleton, create many sessions-per-request.&nbsp; Here’s a solution with <a href="http://nhforge.org/blogs/nhibernate/archive/2009/08/29/part-7-nhibernate-and-ninject-for-asp-net-mvc.aspx">Ninject</a> (not that I’m picking on Ninject, because I love its very slick contextual binding, but because most other IoC containers have a similar solution, like <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/06/14/Using-NHibernate-Session-Per-Request-with-WCF-Windsor-Integration.aspx">per-session with WCF &amp; Windsor</a>).<br />
<br />
Basically, the solutions mentioned above will following an approach like this: <br />
<br />
a) Hook into the beginning of a request, and create the ISession from the ISessionFactory. <br />
b) Set it in the HttpContext.Current or OperationContext.Current’s dictionaries. <br />
c) Get this property in all the dependencies that need it. <br />
d) At the end of the request, Dispose() the ISession.<br />
<br />
OK, pretty simple and straightforward solution, but there’s one key thing that really bugs me is that by doing this we have introduced a dependency…that is, HttpContext.Current[].&nbsp; That, or you could wrap that around a class, like SessionManager, again, basically coupling to a dependency under a different name.&nbsp; With Autofac, we can bypass steps b and c entirely and only worry about the beginning and end of a request.<br />
<br />
To start off, here's the basic wiring needed:<br />
<div style="text-align: left;"><blockquote><div class="csharpcode"><pre class="alt">1:   var cb = new ContainerBuilder(); 
2:   cb.Register(x =&gt; CreateSessionFactory())
       .As&lt;ISessionFactory&gt;()
       .SingletonScoped(); 
3:   cb.Register(x =&gt; x.Resolve&lt;ISessionFactory&gt;().OpenSession())
       .As&lt;ISession&gt;()
       .ContainerScoped(); 
4:   IContainer c = cb.Build(); 
5:  &nbsp;
6:   Assert.AreSame(c.Resolve&lt;ISessionFactory&gt;(), c.Resolve&lt;ISessionFactory&gt;()); 
7:   Assert.AreSame(c.Resolve&lt;ISession&gt;(), c.Resolve&lt;ISession&gt;()); 
8:  &nbsp;
9:   var inner1 = c.CreateInnerContainer(); 
10:  Assert.AreSame(c.Resolve&lt;ISessionFactory&gt;(), inner1.Resolve&lt;ISessionFactory&gt;()); 
11:  Assert.AreNotSame(c.Resolve&lt;ISession&gt;(), inner1.Resolve&lt;ISession&gt;());</pre></div></blockquote></div>That’s the configuration.&nbsp; And that’s it!&nbsp; Nothing more.&nbsp; No additional SessionManager class.&nbsp; No need to use HttpContext.Current to store the session.&nbsp; Just pass ISession in with regular constructor/property injection.<br />
<br />
Here’s how it works:<br />
<br />
Line 2: ISessionFactory is created from CreateSessionFactory().&nbsp; This is a singleton so there will always be one and only one instance of it within the container (and all child containers).<br />
<br />
Line 3: This is where it’s interesting.&nbsp; We’re saying “whenever I need an ISession, resolve ISessionFactory and call OpenSession() on it”.&nbsp; Also, by specifying ContainerScope, we only get 1 instance per-container.<br />
<br />
And this is where it’s sort of confusing with the terminology.&nbsp; You can think of Autofac as a tree of containers.&nbsp; The root container (variable c in this case), can create children containers (inner1 in this case, and inner1 could create an inner2, and so on).&nbsp; So when something is Singleton scoped, that means that the root container, and any child containers (and child’s children) will only have 1 instance of a service.&nbsp; With ContainerScope, each “node = container” in the tree gets 1 instance.<br />
<br />
So back to the unit test above, in line 6 we verify that there is only 1 instance of ISessionFactory.&nbsp; We resolve ISession twice as well, which shows that we get the same instance.<br />
<br />
Line 9, we create an inner container, and here we see that ISessionFactory is the same for both the container <b>c</b> and inner container <b>inner1</b>.&nbsp; However, the ISession resolved is <b>different</b> between the two.<br />
Thus, by specifying ContainerScope, you can very easily group <i>multiple</i> services and dependencies together as one unit.&nbsp; Implementing the Unit of Work pattern is insanely easy with Autofac.&nbsp; Create services A, which depends on B, which depends on C, which all the previous depends on D.&nbsp; Resolve A within a new inner container, and B, C, and D will always be the same instances.&nbsp; Resolve A in another inner container and you will get a new set of instances.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, Autofac will automatically call Dispose() on all resolved services once the container is disposed.&nbsp; So for the above, once <b>inner1</b>.Dispose() is called, ISession.Dispose() is automatically called.&nbsp; If you needed to, you can very easily hook into this mechanism and implement things like transactions and rollbacks.<br />
<br />
I hope this blog post clears things up a little bit about Autofac’s ContainerScope!</div>

Heya Bailey! Think there is more than one &#39;Nick&#39; lurking around your blog (or else I have a case of amnesia :))<br /><br />Love the article, definitely need more info like this around the &#39;net.<br /><br />Nick (mk II)</div>

Thanks for dropping by Nick!<br /><br />To answer the question, what I ended up doing was creating a set of services for each request/session, basically like how I described in my post.<br /><br />I also wrote my own custom interception module (took some ideas from the one in contrib) based on Castle&#39;s DynamicProxy2.<br /><br />The main difference was that my interceptors work iff methods have specific attributes, and with that I was able to selectively say which methods got transactions (among other things).<br /><br />This made things really easy because I could have the transaction span multiple methods as one huge call or a simple 1 line method depending on where my transaction attributes appear in the code.</div>

I&#39;ve been toying with a similar approach, but I&#39;m uncertain about how to manage NHibernate&#39;s Transaction (Commits and Rollbacks) in this scenario.  I&#39;ve seen examples that make use of TransactionAttributes (in the case of MVC apps), and previously I had been managing transactions in the begin/end request events (in global.asax), but that ties every request to a transaction which isn&#39;t necessary.  How did you go about handling transactions in this scenario?</div>
