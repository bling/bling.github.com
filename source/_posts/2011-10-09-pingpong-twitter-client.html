<p>I have a whole <a href="http://blingcode.blogspot.com/2011/09/push-driven-development-with-reactive.html">series</a> dedicated to blogging about how I wrote a Twitter client from scratch, but if I want anyone to actually use it, I better do some advertising :-D.</p> <p>ping.pong is a fast and lightweight Twitter client written in Silverlight.&nbsp; As of this moment it targets v4 but will likely target v5 whenever that is released.</p> <p>Here are some highlights…</p> <h3>Visually Pleasing</h3> <p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-9wwcsDIu5Yg/TpHayG-NVXI/AAAAAAAAAHg/-Jo9iq0ghOA/image%25255B15%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="377" height="280"></p> <p>The UI is based on your typical column-based design.&nbsp; The column widths will automatically resize to take up all available horizontal space.&nbsp; There is no horizontal scrolling.</p> <h3><strong>Access to the Streaming API</strong></h3> <p>No more rate limits!&nbsp; Your timeline is connected directly with Twitter’s streaming API, which means whenever someone you follow tweets you will know about it in almost near real-time.&nbsp; Searching is also done through the streaming API.</p> <h3>Fast &amp; Lightweight</h3> <p>ping.pong was built to run fast with low CPU utilization.&nbsp; Even when stream searching for “e” (yes, the letter E), the CPU usage stays under 15%.&nbsp; The maximum number of tweets that Twitter sends appears to be 50 per second.</p> <h3>Conversations</h3> <p>ping.pong will quickly show an entire tweet conversation by navigating reply tags back to the original tweet that started it all.</p> <h3>Free &amp; Open Source</h3> <p>The full source code for ping.pong can be found on <a href="https://github.com/bling/Ping.Pong">GitHub</a>.&nbsp; You can compile it, make modifications as you please, and run it yourself.&nbsp; The only thing missing is the consumer keys which uniquely identifies this client from another.&nbsp; You can generate them through Twitter once you have a developer account.</p> <h3>Installer</h3> <p>The latest and greatest can be quickly installed from <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2072014/Ping.Pong/PingPongTestPage.html">here</a>.&nbsp; Check back periodically for updates!</p>  </div>
