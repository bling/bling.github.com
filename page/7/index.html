    Let’s say you have something like this: public void MyClass { public ILog Logger { get; set; } } And you simply want Unity to inject an instance of ILog such that its name is requestingDependency.GetType().FullName, which in this case would be Full.Namespace.MyClass. I&rsquo;ll leave it up to the exercise of the reader, but if you search for &lsquo;log4net and Unity&rsquo; you will find some working solutions which IMO are way too long to solve this. I have obviously taken for granted the features of Windsor and Autofac too much because I expected something like this to be easily done in 2-3 lines of code. After a lot of cursing I&rsquo;ve come up with something that&rsquo;s almost as short and gets the job done: public class LoggingExtension : UnityContainerExtension { protected override void Initialize() { this.Context.Strategies.AddNew(UnityBuildStage.PreCreation); } private class LogBuilderStrategy : BuilderStrategy { private readonly Stack buildKeys = new Stack(); public override void PreBuildUp(IBuilderContext context) { var type = ((NamedTypeBuildKey)context.BuildKey).Type; if (type == typeof(ILog)) { if (this.buildKeys.Count &lt; 1) throw new InvalidOperationException(&quot;Log instances cannot be resolved directly.&quot;); context.Existing = LogManager.GetLog(this.buildKeys.Peek()); } this.buildKeys.Push(type); } public override void PostBuildUp(IBuilderContext context) { this.buildKeys.Pop(); } } } If you noticed, I had to cast to NamedTypeBuildKey, which unfortunately means I’m still stuck with Unity 1.2&hellip;

    One of the most important things for any developer is to be well rounded. They should know about functional, imperative, object-oriented, aspect-oriented programming, among others. They should know the difference between dynamic and static languages. They should know the difference between scripting, interpreted, compiled languages. Why? It opens your mindset. It lets you see things in a different light, which ultimately changes the way you will write your code, and for the better. The best example is when C# introduced lambdas and LINQ. All of a sudden, the masses saw the benefits of functional programming style and how it greatly makes code succinct. Here, I give an example of what knowing a little about Powershell did to save me a lot of time. I use git-tfs to make my day job a little less painful every day, because I cannot stand TFS, at all. In their latest release, they decided not to tag every changeset. I like my things consistent, so I decided to go back in history to untag all the changesets. Unfortunately, git doesn&rsquo;t have a mass untag, and you must untag each branch individually with git tag -d name_of_tag. This is how you do it with Powershell: 50000..40000 | % { git tag -d &quot;tfs/default/C$_&quot; } 50000..40000 creates an list of numbers from 50,000 to 40,000, then it gets piped | into a foreach loop % to run the git tag command by generating the tag name with the current loop item $_. Why was this awesome? I didn&rsquo;t have to open up Visual Studio, or a text editor, or anything. I just typed it into the shell.

    It’s been a while since I last blogged, but I want to get back into it….I just haven’t thought about what I wanna blog about yet.&nbsp; I’m thinking of doing some sort of multi-part series on a topic but haven’t decided on what yet.&nbsp; Nonetheless, just to get the ball rolling again here’s a quick blog post on some of the tools I use to do my every day job that’s in addition to your typical .NET developer tool chain. General StrokeIt:&nbsp; Funny name aside, on any clean install of Windows this is the first thing I install.&nbsp; I load up IE and I download this, followed by Chrome/Firefox.&nbsp; It is a mouse gesture program that affects all of Windows.&nbsp; By holding down the right mouse button, and making gestures you can do common tasks like minimize (drag SW), maximize (drag NE), close (draw a C), and others.&nbsp; It’s much faster than clicking the minimize/maximize buttons.&nbsp; For web browsing, creating and close tabs are drag SE and drag NW respectively.&nbsp; Back is W.&nbsp; Forward is E.&nbsp; Working this way is faster than any keyboard shortcut. Console2:&nbsp; It’s not a necessity, but it’s nice to be able to use a console with a better looking font.&nbsp; You can easily customize to run another shell, and in my case I have Powershell as the shell. VirtuaWin:&nbsp; Ironically I don’t use any virtual desktops, but this app creates a nice middle click on any window that lets you mark it as ‘always on top’. Vim:&nbsp; It was an awful, painful 2 weeks to learn this thing but I’m sure glad I did. Development/Visual Studio Resharper:&nbsp; This one doesn’t need much mentioning as anyone serious about programming in .NET has either heard of it, use it, or use one of its competitors like CodeRush. AllMargins:&nbsp; This hidden gem is an awesome extension has brings a bunch of very useful features to the editor.&nbsp; It brings structural highlighting, highlighting matching words under caret, and RockScroll inspired scroll bar, and it does it all with little to no cost in performance. Productivity Power Tools:&nbsp; There’s only 2 that I use here: document tabs, and moving lines.&nbsp; All the rest are either eye candy, negligible enhancements, or just plain too slow to be any use in large solutions (solution navigator I’m looking at you!!). XAML Intellisense Presenter:&nbsp; This is a must-have for anyone who works with XAML in VS regularly.&nbsp; Resharper 6 may soon make this obsolete, however… ILSpy/dotPeek:&nbsp; Decompilers.&nbsp; ‘nuff said. Snoop:&nbsp; Staple tool for WPF developers to inspect the visual/logical tree.&nbsp; There’s also WPF Inspector which has a much nicer UI, but unfortunately doesn’t perform as fast. Profiling ANTS/dotTrace/YourKit/etc:&nbsp; I’ve used many performance/memory profilers, and those 3 are the ones I like the most.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they all do things the others don’t, and all these things are very useful, so you still end up needing to use all of them to fix the particular problem you’re working on. WinDbg: It isn’t every day I use this, but I’m sure glad to know that such a thing exists and the amount of power it gives me. Scripting PowerGUI:&nbsp; Best tool I found for editing PowerShell.&nbsp; The intellisense is great and has all the things you were expect when debugging through scripts. Miscellaneous BareTail:&nbsp; Amazing program which watches log files in real time and can highlight rows based on a search pattern. PowerShell/Cygwin/MSYS:&nbsp; I used to be a Cygwin/MSYS user because back in the day I liked to install a different Linux distribution every week so I learned some basic Bash commands and that carried over to Windows.&nbsp; Since PowerShell now exists, we have a real shell in Windows, so I’ve switched over to learn it, since as a Windows developer it’s more applicable to the kind of work I do. &nbsp; And there’s more but that’s enough for now! Comments bling Actually, Cygwin/MSYS used to be in my tool chain, but I&#39;ve made an effort to learn PowerShell by making it my shell. I&#39;m still thrown off sometimes because PowerShell operates on objects, rather than text. Sometimes this makes it easier, sometimes harder. Grep comes to mind. Check out BareTail if you want to watch log files in real time. Mike McG Nice post! Gonna check out XAML Intellisense Presenter, All Margins, and PowerGUI. For Always on Top functionality, I&#39;ve relied on PowerMenu. It doesn&#39;t have the middle-click (gotta go through the app menu in the window chrome), but it also lets you Minimize to Tray. StexBar is also pretty neat-o, lets you create your own buttons on the Explorer button bar. Maybe due to my *nix background, I also install Cygwin (including sshd which allows me to use Cygwin through PuTTY rather than cmd.exe), grepWin (regular expression per-directory content search), and Tail for Win32 (to watch log files). (In addition to Tail I install Less for Windows and hook it up to StexBar, then use Shift+F to watch files).

    Decompilers in the .NET space has changed a lot since the announcement from Red Gate that they were going to start charging for Reflector, which was the defacto most important/useful tool in any developer&rsquo;s tool belt. This blog post will be a quick overview to take a look at all the new contenders that have cropped up in the .NET space to see if any of them can dethrone Reflector as the decompiler of choice. This is only taking a look at the tools as a stand alone product and excludes any IDE integration. To start, let&rsquo;s take a look at Reflector. Red Gate Reflector (7.1.0.143) Having been around for years, Reflector is a rock solid product that sets the standard for everything else. It has a simple straight forward interface and has a large following with many 3rd party addins. It has a search which lets you find types, and an analyzer which shows you incoming and outgoing calls for any method. It also has the most options for decompiling, giving choices from C# to VB and even Delphi. Another useful feature is being able change the framework from .NET to WPF to Silverlight. As of this version it looks like they added tabs, but it for me it only used one at a time…perhaps a limitation of the trial version. ILSpy (1.0.0.822) This open source offering at this point looks the same as Reflector did just before Red Gate took over. It has all the necessities, including search and analyze. It can only view one thing at a time, and doesn&rsquo;t have support for addins yet. However, progress on this project is blazing fast and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before it reaches feature parity with the rest. JustDecompile Beta (2011.1.516.2) First impression was, damn, this is a nice pretty WPF app. Onwards, it has a predefined assembly list of .NET2, 4, and Silverlight, which is nice. What&rsquo;s nicer is that you can save a predefined list for use later, a feature that&rsquo;s absent from the others. It has search by type, and search by symbol, however, the search is noticeably slower than everything else I tried. Also, the actual decompiling is much slower than the rest as well. Like ILSpy, it can only view one thing at a time. Decompiling to C# and VB are supported, but no IL yet. dotPeek EAP (1.0.0.1219) I tried an EAP build and I was blown away. I may be biased because I&rsquo;m a Resharper user, but having almost all of the keyboard shortcuts I have in my muscle memory work in dotPeek was a welcome surprise. The keyboard navigation makes dotPeek by far the best tool for navigating. While the others have searches, they only do so at the type level. With dotPeek (just like Resharper), you can search by type, current type, and even private members. Inheritance searching like finding implementations, etc., all of that works. Simply amazing. Oh, and it also has full tab support. It was also fast as well, which was a surprise considering it&rsquo;s searching through the entire framework. Searching all symbols for m_ brought a list up in 2 seconds, and subsequent keystrokes narrowing it down occurred within half a second. The downside? No support for decompiling to IL, and lambdas aren&rsquo;t fully supported yet. I&rsquo;m sure these will be done by the time it&rsquo;s released. Conclusion I guess the most important thing I should be looking at is the actual decompiler, rather than the bells and whistles. If that&rsquo;s what I looked at, this would be a pretty boring post because only Reflector is able to decompile everything out there. JustDecompile failed to decompile some of the assemblies I threw it at it. dotPeek at this stage doesn&rsquo;t have good lambda support (if at all). ILSpy decompiles very well at this point and I&rsquo;d have to go out of my way to find an example where Reflector does it better than ILSpy. In conclusion, I love dotPeek just because of the awesomeness that is Resharper keyboard shortcuts. For everything else, ILSpy does the job. I&rsquo;m actually pretty thankful that Red Gate decided to charge money for Reflector, because that inspired so much competition and we already have 3 viable replacements, all of which are free &ndash; something that wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if Reflector remained free.

    I spent a good few hours yesterday trying out a new programming font.&nbsp; It’s a personal thing.&nbsp; I like switch fonts every couple weeks, and while Consolas is an excellent font and I have nothing against it, to me, it’s….too simple.&nbsp; For most people, the defaults are just fine, and they can’t be bothered to try another font.&nbsp; But for me, I want my font to speak to me a little.&nbsp; But enough of that voodoo magic stuff. The problem with sites that survey fonts is that it’s hard to compare quickly one with the next.&nbsp; For example, this excellent article comparing 42 fonts on CodeProject is one of the most comprehensive surveys, but even with that I can’t really tell if I prefer one font over another.&nbsp; So, since I’m going to be doing this from time to time, I wrote a quick WPF app. The XAML is simple, only this: &lt;StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal"&gt; &lt;ListBox IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" SelectedItem="{Binding CurrentFont}" ItemsSource="{Binding Fonts}" /&gt; &lt;TextBlock FontFamily='{Binding CurrentFont}' FontSize="14" Text="{Binding Code}" /&gt; &lt;/StackPanel&gt; And the code is just as simple, only this: public class ViewModel { public static readonly DependencyProperty CurrentFontProperty = DependencyProperty.Register("CurrentFont", typeof(FontFamily), typeof(ViewModel)); public FontFamily CurrentFont { get { return (FontFamily)GetValue(CurrentFontProperty); } set { SetValue(CurrentFontProperty, value); } } public List&lt;FontFamily&gt; Fonts { get; private set; } public string Code { get { return "insert what you want to see"; } } public ViewModel() { Fonts = new List&lt;FontFamily&gt;(); Fonts.AddRange(System.Windows.Media.Fonts.SystemFontFamilies); } } And with this, you get something like this.&nbsp; The coding sample is taken from Coding Horror. Yep, my current chosen font is BPMono. For the lazy, here’s the project on GitHub.
