  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting lately with <a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/TW/TeamCity+EAP?eap">TeamCity 5 EAP</a> and so far it&rsquo;s been a pretty awesome experience.  I was up and running within minutes and I was swarmed with beautiful graphs and statistics with specifics even per-test.  Getting something like that up with <a href="http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/">CC.NET</a> is not a trivial task.</p>

<p>Anywho, with TC5 code coverage is one of the cool new features added for .NET, but unfortunately only <a href="http://nunit.org">NUnit</a> is supported.  Not that that&rsquo;s a bad thing, but some people  prefer to use other testing tools.  Two notable contenders are <a href="http://xunit.codeplex.com">xUnit.net</a> and <a href="http://www.gallio.org">MbUnit</a>.</p>

<p>I like the fact (pun intended) that xUnit.net makes it a point to prevent you from doing bad practices (like <code>[ExpectedException]</code>), and I like how MbUnit is so bleeding edge with useful features (like <code>[Parallelizable]</code> and a vast availability of assertions).</p>

<p>And with that I set up to figure out how to get TC working with Gallio, but the following should work with any test runner.</p>

<p>It certainly was a pain to set up because it took a lot of trial and error but eventually I figured it out.  I analyzed the build logs provided in each build report and noticed something interesting&hellip;specifically:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[13:51:23]: ##teamcity[importData type=’dotNetCoverage’ tool=’ncover’ file=’C:\TeamCity5\buildAgent\temp\buildTmp\tmp1C93.tmp’]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[13:51:30]: ##teamcity[buildStatisticValue key=’CodeCoverageL’ value=’94.85067’]
</span><span class='line'>[13:51:30]: ##teamcity[buildStatisticValue key=’CodeCoverageM’ value=’97.32143’]
</span><span class='line'>[13:51:30]: ##teamcity[buildStatisticValue key=’CodeCoverageC’ value=’98.68421’]
</span><span class='line'>[13:51:30]: ##teamcity[buildStatisticValue key=’CodeCoverageAbsLCovered’ value=’921.0’]
</span><span class='line'>[13:51:30]: ##teamcity[buildStatisticValue key=’CodeCoverageAbsMCovered’ value=’218.0’]
</span><span class='line'>[13:51:30]: ##teamcity[buildStatisticValue key=’CodeCoverageAbsCCovered’ value=’75.0’]
</span><span class='line'>[13:51:30]: ##teamcity[buildStatisticValue key=’CodeCoverageAbsLTotal’ value=’971.0’]

</span><span class='line'>[13:51:30]: ##teamcity[buildStatisticValue key=’CodeCoverageAbsCTotal’ value=’76.0’]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first message happens after NCover.Console is done its thing.  After NCoverExplorer is done its thing, the statistics are published.  I set out to mimic this functionality with Gallio, but what&rsquo;s described here should work with any test runner.</p>

<ol>
<li>Disable code coverage in TC.  We&rsquo;re doing it manually instead.</li>
<li>In your build script, run your unit tests with NCover and generate a coverage.xml report.</li>
<li>Run NCoverExplorer on coverage.xml and generate reports ncoverexplorer.xml and index.html.</li>
<li>Create a zip file of index.html and name it coverage.zip.</li>
<li>Configure coverage.zip to be an artifact in your TC configuration (this is to enable the tab).</li>
<li>Parse out ncoverexplorer.xml with XPath and output the statistics.</li>
</ol>


<p>Certainly a lot of things to do just for the sake of pretty statistics reporting&hellip;.but it was the weekend and I was bored.  With the help of <a href="http://msbuildtasks.tigris.org/">MSBuildCommunityTasks</a>, the zip file and XML parsing was made a lot easier.</p>

<p>After that, viola!  Code coverage + Gallio on TeamCity 5!!!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, NCoverExplorer&rsquo;s report only reports the # total of classes and nothing about unvisited or covered, so for those values I set to 0/0/0 (BTW, you need all values present for the statistics to show).  A task for next weekend!!!</p>

<p>(Edit: I suppose I could should also mention that you could technically avoid all the trouble above and hack it with this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#if NUNIT
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>using TestFixtureAttribute = NUnit.Framework.TestFixtureAttribute;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>using TestAttribute = NUnit.Framework.TestAttribute;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>#endif</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And it&rsquo;ll work just fine as well).</p>

Inevitably as a project gets more complicated, you will need to start using more features of your IoC container.  Autofac has built-in support for property injection by hooking into the OnActivating or OnActivated events, which basically set all public properties (or only those which are unset).

However, I didn&#8217;t really like this because once you start using properties, it&#8217;s not as clear cut as constructors that you are using injection.  It becomes hard to manage later on when you have many properties which some should be injected and others should be manually set in code.  Autofac&#8217;s inject all or only-null approach doesn&#8217;t fit the bill when a class gets a little more complicated.

I set up to fix this by writing a custom module, and it turned out to be very very simple.  With attributes, we can mimic functionality that&#8217;s used in Ninject.

Here&#8217;s the module code:
<pre>
public class MemberInjectionModule : IModule
{
  public void Configure(IContainer container)
  {
    container.ComponentRegistered += (oo, ee) =>
      ee.ComponentRegistration.Activated += (o, e) =>
    {
      const BindingFlags flags = BindingFlags.Instance |
                                 BindingFlags.NonPublic |
                                 BindingFlags.Public;
      var type = e.Instance.GetType();
      foreach (var field in type.GetFields(flags))
      {
        if (field.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(InjectedAttribute), true).Length > 0)
          field.SetValue(e.Instance, e.Context.Resolve(field.FieldType));
      }
      foreach (var prop in type.GetProperties(flags))
      {
        if (prop.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(InjectedAttribute), true).Length > 0)
        {
          if (prop.GetIndexParameters().Length > 0)
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Indexed properties cannot be injected.");

          prop.SetValue(e.Instance, e.Context.Resolve(prop.PropertyType), null);
        }
      }
    };
  }
}
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Field | AttributeTargets.Property)]
public class InjectedAttribute : Attribute { }
</pre>
And that&#8217;s it!  Pretty basic reflection here stuff here, but as you can see&#8230;iterate through all fields and properties (including privates), and try to resolve them.

Now, you can just RegisterModule(new MemberInjectionModule()), and inside your services you simply annotate your properties/fields with the [Injected] attribute, like so:
<pre>
public class SomeService : ISomeService
{
  [Injected]
  protected ISomeOtherService SomeOtherService { get; set; }
}
</pre>
And now, it&#8217;s a very clear cut way of explicitly defining which properties (and fields) should be injected.  Also, it&#8217;s also a simple string property away defined in the attribute if you want to specify a named service, which I&#8217;ll leave the the reader to implement :)</div>

Ooops, I forgot to mention that it&#8217;s easily mockable as well.
<pre>
public class UserService : IUserService {
  public UserService(ISessionFactory factory, UsersRepositoryFactory usersFactory) { ... }
}
</pre>
So that&#8217;s the basic thing right.  So now, with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq/">Moq</a>, we can do this:
<pre>
var mockUserRepo = new Mock&lt;IUsersRepository&gt;();
mockUserRepo.Setup(x =&gt; x.GetUser(It.IsAny&lt;string&gt;())).Returns(() =&gt; someUser);

var userService = new UserService(..., x => mockUserRepo.Object);
</pre>
So what I&#8217;ve basically done is insert a lambda expression into the constructor, which is the delegate, which always returns my mock repository.  Pretty nifty methinks!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
NHibernate is a beast let me tell you!  I think I already mentioned this in the previous post, but NHibernate definitely has a VERY high learning curve.  If it wasn&#8217;t for FluentNHibernate I&#8217;d probably still be struggling with XML mapping files right now.<br />
<br />
But anywho, it didn&#8217;t take long for me to run into very many problems with NHibernate.  It&#8217;s not really NHibernate&#8217;s fault, but more of maybe I&#8217;m trying to use the wrong tool for the job.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m using DDD for my project, and there&#8217;s a clear separation between the client and the domain.  I got lazy and I didn&#8217;t make any DTOs for my entities, and just used the [DataContract] and [DataMember] to have WCF automatically generated &#8220;DTO&#8221;s for me (and in the options turn OFF reusing assemblies).<br />
<br />
(Disclaimer:  I am *not* by any means knowledgeable about NHibernate, but maybe, just maybe what I say here might point other people in the right direction)<br />
<br />
OK, all is good.  I can store my entities in the database, I can read them back.  So I fire up my client and read some users, and it blows up.  NHibernate by default lazy loads everything.  Here&#8217;s what I originally had in my UsersRepository<br />
<pre>public IEnumerable&lt;User&gt; GetAll() {
using (var session = _factory.OpenSession())
return session.CreateCriteria&lt;User&gt;().List&lt;User&gt;();
}
</pre><br />
It looks pretty innocent.  But it blows up.  Why?  If Users has a collection of other entities (which mine did), they are <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> loaded with the above code.  They are loaded on-demand, i.e. lazy loaded.  So when my WCF service finally returns the objects and serializes them, it pukes and throws an exception because the session was long closed already.<br />
<br />
Easy solution was to Not.LazyLoad() all my collections.  Now here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking I might not be using the right tool for the job because I am purposely disabling one of the key features of NHibernate.  By default, caching is always enabled, and I couldn&#8217;t find anywhere how to globally turn it off.  You must go class by class.<br />
<br />
OK, so on to my next problem.  I soon ran into issues with entities not being unique.  I would have code like this in my UserService:<br />
<pre>public void AddProduct(string username, Guid productId) {
var user = _usersRepository.GetUser(username);
var product = _productRepository.GetProduct(productId);
user.Products.Add(product);
_usersRepository.Store(user);
}
</pre><br />
Again, this puked.  The problem here was after my GetUser call, inside my repository, like my first example, I had a using(session), which closed when the method ended.  Shortly after, I am trying to update the same user, but with a *different* session.  NHibernate doesn&#8217;t like this, an NHibernate.NonUniqueObjectException is thrown, and I had a new problem to deal with.<br />
<br />
It became clear I had to actively manage the sessions somehow, and the best place would be to have them in my services, which typically each method had a &#8220;unit of work&#8221; placed on them.<br />
<br />
So the goal I wanted to accomplish was to initiate a new session at the beginning of a service method, call a repository multiple times, close the session, and then exit the method.<br />
<br />
So how can we achieve that?<br />
<br />
I thought of a couple things, and the first thing I did actually was to use AOP style and use Autofac with Castle.DynamicProxy.  I created an interceptor for my service, and before invocation I opened a session, then manually called a property setter for a CurrentSession, and after invocation close the session.<br />
<br />
It did the job, but had some problems:<br />
a) It did a little too much black magic for me.  All methods got intercepted.<br />
b) I still had to manually set the CurrentSession property of my repositories.  Sooner or later I&#8217;m sure to run in the threading problems.<br />
<br />
After I got that half working I scrapped it and tried to come up with something better.  This is what I came up with:<br />
<pre>public delegate IUsersRepository UsersRepositoryFactory(ISession session);

public class UserService : IUserService {
public UserService(ISessionFactory factory, UsersRepositoryFactory usersFactory) { ... }
}

public class UsersRepository : IUsersRepository {
public UsersRepository(ISession session) { ... }
}
</pre><br />
Now, when I call a method on my UserService, I do this:<br />
<pre>public void AddProduct(string username, Guid productId) {
using (var session = _factory.OpenSession()) {
var userRepo = _userRepoFactory(session);
var productRepo = _productFactory(session);
...
}
}
</pre><br />
And, of course, the Autofac code:<br />
<pre>b.Register&lt;UsersRepository&gt;().As&lt;IUsersRepository&gt;().FactoryScoped();
b.RegisterGeneratedFactory&lt;UsersRepositoryFactory&gt;();
</pre><br />
More details on the delegate factory <a href="http://code.google.com/p/autofac/wiki/DelegateFactories">here</a>.  But basically, with Autofac I have told it to inject delegates into my UserService, and those delegates can create new instances of my user repository by passing in the current session.<br />
<br />
You&#8217;ll also notice I had a products repository as well.  With these delegate factories I can create up multiple repositories on the fly with the same session (and all the good NHibernate stuff that comes with that).<br />
<br />
Sure, there&#8217;s a whole bunch of using(var session) boilerplate now, but it&#8217;s explicit, clear, and allows for a lot of fine-grained control.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I have since dropped this approach and I&#8217;m currently injecting ISessions into my constructors by using Autofac&#8217;s container-scope (something that took me a while to understand).</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that I have to remove db4o from my project, but I can&rsquo;t say this was unexpected.  The CTO finally came to me today to voice his concerns on using an object database rather than a relational database.</p>

<p>As typical of many organizations, we have a database team dedicated to maintaining the integrity and performance of our main product.  We are also stored procedure happy and every write <em>and read</em> operation goes through a stored procedure&hellip;.so you can say I was pretty gutsy to even consider using an object database ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>It was fun nonetheless&hellip;</p>

<p>Sooooo&hellip;.which ORM to use?  I&rsquo;ve already read of <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=entity+framework+vote+of+no+confidence">all the things about the Entity Framework</a> already, so I didn&rsquo;t even bother considering it.  Choices came down to just a few:
&ndash; <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/activerecord/index.html">Castle.ActiveRecord</a>
&ndash; <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/">Fluent NHibernate</a>
&ndash; <a href="http://www.subsonicproject.com/">SubSonic</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve initially started with Fluent NHibernate.  The main reason is because it&rsquo;s got really good documentation for beginners like me who&rsquo;ve never used NHibernate, and has more configuration options via code.  Even so, it didn&rsquo;t take long for me to run into gazillions of mapping errors though :&ndash;[</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still undecided whether I prefer <code>ClassMap&lt;&gt;</code> or <code>ActiveRecord</code> attributes though&hellip;</p>

<p>I started porting all my repositories to using NHibernate, and for the most part it wasn&rsquo;t too bad.  I&rsquo;ve learned some things along the way like lazy loading and cascading, but the conclusion is having Fluent NHibernate with pretty code completion isn&rsquo;t going to prevent the need to actually learn NHibernate the old-fashioned way, although it definitely got me up and running a lot faster.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll probably write up a quick repository implementation with SubSonic as well as part of my prototype to see which I like.  SubSonic definitely looks more &lsquo;hip&rsquo; with it&rsquo;s very flashy and web 2.0ey looking website :)</p>
