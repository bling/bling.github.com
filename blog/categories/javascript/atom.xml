<p>Well, it’s been quite a while since I’ve blogged about…well…anything, and I figured it’s about time I get off my lazy butt and do something with my spare time on weekends.&nbsp; What better option than to see what all the hype is about Node?&nbsp; I had to do it sooner or later.</p> <p>As any newbie would do, they go to Google and type “nodejs tutorial”.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nodebeginner.org/">The Node Beginner Book</a> came up first, so I went with that.&nbsp; It was an excellent tutorial.&nbsp; Prior to this I also skimmed through the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">JavaScript, The Good Parts</a>, so I had a basic understanding of the language syntax.</p> <p>One of the first oddities I noticed, was that NodeJS seems to have a convention of comma-first.&nbsp; You notice this immediately because most examples start with require(‘module’), and if they require more than one module, the second line is prefixed with a comma (as opposed to the more traditional comma at the end of the line).&nbsp; I apparently missed the <a href="https://gist.github.com/357981">discussion</a> by 2 years!&nbsp; It was still interesting nonetheless.</p> <p>As someone with a strong .NET background, I definitely experienced all the usual ‘gotchas’:</p> <ul> <li>== vs ===  <li>falsey values  <li>variable hoisting</li></ul> <p>Once you understand all of these things, Javascript isn’t so bad.&nbsp; Oh, and of course understanding closures will get you <em>a long</em> way in being effective with Javascript, because that’s what you need to use to do proper scoping.&nbsp; If C# didn’t have lambdas and closures it would have been a much longer journey to “get it”.</p> <p>Not too longer after, I deployed my first Heroku app running on NodeJS.</p> <p>Anyways, enough with the prologue…I won’t bore you with anymore beginner/tutorial stuff.</p> <p>Let’s get on with what I plan on doing over a multi-part blog series.&nbsp; When I build something on my own time, I can’t build something just for the hell of it to learn something….that’s not enough.&nbsp; If I build something it has to be useful – something that I (or someone else) will find valuable.</p> <p>I won’t reveal what it is yet, but it’s going to involve Node/MongoDB on the backend, with Backbone on the front-end.&nbsp; Should be fun :-)</p>  </div>
